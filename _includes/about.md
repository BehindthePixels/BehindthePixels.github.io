# About Me

I am Edward(Shiqiu) Liu, a Principal Research Scientist and Senior Manager at NVIDIA Applied Deep Learning Research, where I currently explore the exciting application of deep learning in real-time graphics pipeline and other topics.

In the last several years at NVIDIA I have contributed to the early research and deveopment of several crtical technology for next-gen real-time graphics, including [DLSS](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-2-0-a-big-leap-in-ai-rendering/), [real-time ray tracing](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/20-series/rtx/) and [VR rendering](https://developer.nvidia.com/vrworks).

I spent most of my college career at South China University of Technology writing software renderers from scratch. Later I joined the graphics lab at Georgia Institute of Technology as a research assistant, working on [a project](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004605) involving machine learning, fluid simulation and rendering. I also used to be an intern at Microsoft Research Asia and Tencent, where I worked on GPU based video codec and gaming. 

In my spare time, I also like movies, skiing, travelling and landscape photography. And here is a video of me getting the [3rd prize of National English Speech Competition in China](http://contest.i21st.cn/article/speaking/1061_1.html).
